 Health is an important aspect of every life. For all the necessary records related to health,
 medical records are employed. Traditionally these are in the form of paper and can often
 be misplaced, or suffer from tear and damage The project aims at resolving this problem
 by using an Electronic Health Record system that scans and stores the medical report
 data on the database for anytime access from the user. Users can directly upload their
 report in the form of images or PDFs, that are processed and the data is stored in the
 database. When the user wants to access this data, they can directly see the data as well
 as several analysis that are available on the platform. The proposed approach is designed
 keeping in mind the different technological intricacies involved to provide a fast, secure,
 and most importantly a very user-friendly application that can be operated with ease.
